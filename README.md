# Linear-Algebra-With-Python

This repository is for study of linear algebra. 

Whenever I study linear algebra, I've used [Linear Algebra in the Khan Academy.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)

Also in here, I will arrange the theorem of Linear algebra with python code, numpy, matplotlib and scipyt and so on. 

Later on, I will finally arrange all of math that I've studied mathematics for Machine-Learning. 

probability and statistic, Linear algebra and mulitivariable caculus.

it's just fundamental math I will have continued for it with Khan Academy. 

Maybe If you want to know and study it with my orgarnization, just refer to [hyunyoung2 blog - later on I will register it.]()

Thank you for your reading.
